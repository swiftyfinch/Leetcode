# [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) (Easy)

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2³¹,  2³¹ − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

##### Example 1:

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

##### Example 2:

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

##### Example 3:

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```

##### Example 4:

```
Input: x = 0
Output: 0
```

##### Constraints:

* `-2³¹ <= x <= 2³¹ - 1`
